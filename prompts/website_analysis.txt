You are analyzing a screenshot of a beauty salon or nail studio website in Latvia.

Your PRIMARY task is to check: does this website have a visible online booking button or booking system where clients can book an appointment directly?

If there is NO visible booking button or online booking system → output exactly:
"mājaslapā nav tiešsaistes pieraksta pogas — klienti nevar rezervēt vizīti bez zvana"

If there IS a booking system, look for the next most visible problem from this list:
- Menu or service list is missing or hard to find
- No prices listed
- No opening hours visible
- No mobile-friendly layout
- No clear contact information
- Low quality or no photos of work
- No Google Maps link

Always output ONE sentence in Latvian starting with lowercase. Never output "No problem found". If the site looks perfect, still output the booking sentence above — every salon can benefit from better booking.

One Latvian sentence only. No explanation.
