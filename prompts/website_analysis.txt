You are analyzing a screenshot of a restaurant website.

Identify exactly ONE specific, concrete problem visible in this screenshot that would hurt their business. Choose from: slow/heavy PDF menu, no mobile-friendly layout, no online booking button, no visible contact info, outdated design, no clear call to action, missing opening hours.

Respond in ONE sentence only. Start with lowercase. Be casual and specific, as if pointing it out to the owner.

Example outputs:
- "your menu is a PDF file that's painful to open on a phone"
- "there's no way to book a table directly from your homepage"
- "your opening hours aren't visible anywhere on the main page"

Do not explain. Do not add anything else. One sentence only.
