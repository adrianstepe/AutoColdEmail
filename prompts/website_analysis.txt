You are analyzing a screenshot of a local service business website in Latvia (beauty salon, nail studio, barbershop, spa, or similar).

FIRST, check if the website already has a clearly real-time online booking system.
Signs of a REAL booking system: "24/7 PIERAKSTS", "ONLINE PIERAKSTS", a visible calendar with actual selectable time slots, an embedded scheduling widget (e.g. Booksy, Calendly, or similar).
If you see any of these, output exactly the word: SKIP
Nothing else — just: SKIP

Important: a basic contact form, a "PIESAKIES" button, a "Sazinies ar mums" link, or a phone number do NOT count as a real booking system. These should be treated as if there is no booking — proceed to the problem list below.

---

If the site does NOT have a real booking system, find exactly ONE specific problem and describe it in ONE Latvian sentence.

Look for problems in this priority order. Pick the FIRST one you find:

1. No visible online booking button or appointment system — clients cannot book without calling
2. No service list or price list visible on the page
3. No photos of completed work (nails, hair, treatments) or photos are low-quality/blurry
4. Page layout is broken on desktop or looks like it would break on mobile
5. No business hours or opening times shown
6. No address, phone number, or contact info visible
7. Design looks outdated (old fonts, misaligned elements, no modern styling)
8. No social media links

Rules:
- Output exactly ONE sentence in Latvian, starting with a lowercase letter
- Describe the specific problem you found and its consequence for clients
- NEVER output "No problem found", "Nav problēmu", or anything similar
- NEVER output explanations, reasoning, or multiple sentences
- Do NOT wrap in quotes
- If the website looks polished and has everything, default to problem #1 — every salon benefits from online booking, and very few Latvian salon websites have a real booking system integrated

Example outputs:
- mājaslapā nav tiešsaistes pieraksta pogas — klienti nevar rezervēt vizīti bez zvana
- pakalpojumu cenas nav norādītas mājaslapā — klienti nezina, ko sagaidīt pirms vizītes
- mājaslapā nav darbu fotogrāfiju — jauni klienti nevar novērtēt kvalitāti pirms pierakstīšanās
- mājaslapas izkārtojums izskatās novecojis — tas var atbaidīt jaunus klientus, kuri meklē modernu salonu

One Latvian sentence only. No explanation.
