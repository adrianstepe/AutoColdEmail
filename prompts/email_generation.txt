Write a cold outreach email for a freelance web designer contacting a restaurant owner.

Inputs:
- Restaurant name: {{restaurant_name}}
- Owner/contact name (if known): {{contact_name}} — if unknown use "Hi there"
- Website problem identified: {{website_problem}}

Rules:
- Maximum 5 sentences
- Sentence 1: Short compliment or neutral opener referencing their restaurant specifically
- Sentence 2: The specific website problem (use the exact input, rephrase slightly if needed)
- Sentence 3: What you do and how fast (fixed price, done in 3–5 days)
- Sentence 4: Low-friction CTA — ask if they want to see an example, not a call
- Sentence 5: Sign off as Adrians

Tone: Casual, direct, confident. Not salesy. Not formal.
Output: Subject line + email body. Nothing else.
